Project 0

This is a single page blog that alows users to click an image for inspiration to write about.  The image displayed is linked to the submission on click.  There is also a hidden field that records the time of the submission. This alows the submisssion to organized by the photo of inspiration in addition to most recent posts.
After the form is clicked the information is sent to the tabs below to be displayed. The first spot is the most recent. (debated writing code that would delet anything older than 5 posts).  and the second is under the correct tab of the photo displayed on submit.  The submit also triggers the injection of a new form attached to the content of the form submitted along with a div to submit into below that form.  A 'like' button was also created that keeps a count of how many times the button is clicked, located below the primary form content and above the secondary form.  

I was unable to get the secondary form to submit, or the like button to click.  I am  not sure why i cant reach the element from the dev tools even though it shows on the page.  Would really appreciate some feed back on this, as it had me stuck for a good long while.
